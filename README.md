# Food Nutrition Analysis Project

## Nutritional Information

Smart food labeling provides a comprehensive breakdown of the nutritional information associated with the food product. The AI system scrutinizes the extracted text to ascertain the quantities of macronutrients (such as carbohydrates, proteins, and fats), micronutrients (including vitamins and minerals), and the total caloric content. This information is presented in a user-friendly format, allowing consumers to make informed decisions regarding their dietary choices.

## Ingredient Analysis (Customizable User Profile Later)

A core aspect of smart food labeling is the meticulous analysis of the ingredients employed in food products. The AI system scrutinizes the extracted ingredients list, cross-referencing it against an extensive database of recognized ingredients. This analysis aids in identifying specific components, including allergens, additives, preservatives, or artificial sweeteners that may be present in the product. This level of transparency empowers consumers to quickly ascertain whether a product aligns with their dietary needs or restrictions.
